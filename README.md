## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as
close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

-   See hover states for interactive elements
    -   In the thumbnail picture.
    -   In the NFT name.
    -   In the author name

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic **HTML5** markup
-   **CSS3** with custom properties
-   [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - stylesheet language that’s
    compiled to CSS
    -   ITCSS + BEM Methologies.

### Continued development

The next step is to convert this NFT card into a web component with the help of
[LIT](https://lit.dev), a simple library for building fast, lightweight web
components.

On the other hand I will continue looking for new challenges in Frontend Mentor.
