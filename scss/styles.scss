// 01 - Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
@import "./settings";

// 02 - Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
@import "./tools";

// 03 - Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
@import "./generic";

// 04 - Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
@import "./elements";

// 05 - Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example the media object known from OOCSS
@import "./objects";

// 06 - Components – specific UI components. This is where most of our work takes place. We often compose UI components of Objects and Components
@import "./components";

// 07 - Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, e.g. hide helper class
@import "./utilities";
